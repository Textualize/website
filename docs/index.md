    Sign up to our [mailing list](http://eepurl.com/hL0BF1) for occasional news about Textualize.

We are known for our Python projects: Rich and Textual in particular.
Between them they are downloaded over **22 million** times a month.

As the world's [most popular programming language](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/), Python has made a huge impact in a broad range of fields from data science to biology. At the same time, web development has become more and more specialized, putting it out of reach for the majority of developers.

We have a solution for that.

 - ### Rich

    The project which started it all.

    In 2020, Will McGugan wrote the first line of Rich, a project which would become one of the most popular in the Python ecosystem.

    Rich started out as a simple tool to colorize text, but has since grown in to a sophisticated library for beautiful formatting in terminal.

    Rich has over **42,000** GitHub stars and counting.

 - ### Textual

    Rapid Application Development, powered by Rich.    

    Expect a lot more from your terminal with this modern API to build interactive applications on par with the Web and Desktop.
    
    !!! info "Coming Soon"

        Run Textual apps in the browser as easily as the terminal. Build web apps with just your Python skills.
